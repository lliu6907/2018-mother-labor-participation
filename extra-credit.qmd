## Setup

Load packages and data:

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(tidyverse)
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)

#| label: load-data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-05-09')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 19)

childcare_costs <- tuesdata$childcare_costs
counties <- tuesdata$counties
```

## Extra credit

**Research Question:** What is the labor force participation of mothers who have children throughout the United States in the year 2018? How does this compare to 2008?

```{r}
#| label: data-wrangling
labor_part_2018 <- childcare_costs |>
  #select relevant columns to use for analysis
  select(county_fips_code, study_year, flfpr_20to64_under6, flfpr_20to64_6to17) |>
  #filter so we only use the year 2018
  filter(study_year == "2018") |>
  #did this justttt in case if there's n/a values
  drop_na() |>
  #combine the column for labor participation of mothers with children under the age
  #of 6 alongside the labor participation of mothers with children 6 to 17.
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c("county_fips_code", "study_year"),
    names_transform = parse_number,
    values_to = "pct"
  ) |>
  #get rid of the name column, which is kindaaa unnecessary :p
  select(-name) |>
  #because there's two rows of the same area (one for the labor participation
  #percentage of mothers with children under 6 age group and the other one for
  #the 6-17 age group), I decided to average them together to get the total
  #labor participation
  group_by(county_fips_code) |>
  summarize(pct = mean(pct))
```
