## Setup

Load packages and data:

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(tidyverse)

#| label: load-data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-05-09')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 19)

childcare_costs <- tuesdata$childcare_costs
counties <- tuesdata$counties
```

## Extra credit

**Research Question:** How does Tompkins county's childcare costs compare to that of Broome county's?

```{r}
#| label: data-tidying

tomp_broom <- childcare_costs |>
  filter(county_fips_code == "36109" | county_fips_code == "36007")
  
```
